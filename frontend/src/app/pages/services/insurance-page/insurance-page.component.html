            Built using the high-definition ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) storm
            surge model, fueled with additional data sets, customized to
            geolocated properties, the Q-risq&nbsp;Analytics solution provides
            the most relevant information as you decide the best approach to the
            storm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a storm makes landfall, Q-risq&nbsp;Analytics focuses on
            creating a hindcast report of the storm’s impact. Storm surge,&nbsp;
            maximum sustained winds, and rainfall totals are displayed in a
            spreadsheet for each address, allowing some claims to be handled
            remotely, saving the insurance company time and money.

            As depicted in this small sample at 36 hours before landfall, we can
            display geocoded addresses (PIFs) at risk of storm surge prior to
            landfall; providing you with the opportunity to notify customers and
            forward important information.

            Each icon represents a geocoded address (PIF) while displaying a
            total count in the table located at the top right corner. Each color
            depicts the maximum wind speed each address will experience during
            the storm. This information is helpful to understand the size and
            scope of assets needed to prepare while focusing your efforts.

            Post-storm analysis for each individual PIF begins within 48 hours
            of landfall. Wind direction, speed, and duration for each side (NW,
            NE, SW, SE) of property is detailed. The Wind and Surge timeseries
            over the entire storm duration details which came first — peak winds
            or peak surge?
